These multiple combinations of different databases are created in the script but there's an assumption behind the split: As the `data_directory` parameter is given, from where the names of the databases (a.k.a subdirectories) are read, <i>one is considered as a test set, one as a validation set and all the others as a training set</i>.\n",

For example, if the training data is from the databases CPSC/CPSC-Extra, INCART, and PTB/PTB-XL Databases, the combined csv files will be named as `CPSC_CPSC-Extra_INCART_PTB_PTBXL.csv`.\n",

As there are 5 different data sources, there are 5 different data splits to be made out of them, i.e., in each split, one spesific dataset is used as testing set and all the others as training set. The `create_data_csvs.py` script will name the resulting csv files using information from the keys of the `train_test_splits` dictionary and from the results of the `MultilabelStratifiedShuffleSplit()` cross validator.

    "</center>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the csvs are separated from each other with `train`, `val` and `test`. Then, as the `train_test_splits` dictionary has keys indexing the splits (e.g. `split_1` and `split_1`), the first index refers to this indexing. The latter index refers to the results of the `MultilabelStratifiedShuffleSplit()` cross validator: As there are 4 different databases from which data is gathered and stratified, it results 4 different splits of training and validation set. So, the latter indexing is due to the functionality of the mentioned cross validator."
