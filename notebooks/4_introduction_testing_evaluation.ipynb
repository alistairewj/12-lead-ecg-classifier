    "Testing phase can be performed either with a single yaml file or with several yaml files located in the same directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make predictions with a trained model, you'll need a csv file to tell a model which parts of the data (i.e., which ECGs) are used as a testing set, and a yaml file which names this csv file for the model. The csv file(s) can be created by following the introductions in the notebook [Introductions for Data Handling](1_introductions_data_handling.ipynb). Yaml files can be created with the notebooks [Yaml files of Database-wise Split for Training and Prediction](2_physionet_DBwise_yaml_files.ipynb) and [Yaml files of Stratified Split for Training and Prediction](2_physionet_stratified_yaml_files.ipynb). And of course, you should have trained a model to test it: To do this, you can find some introduction in the notebook [Introduction for Training a Model](3_introduction_training.ipynb). \n",

    "<font color ='red'> **NOTE!** </font> *Before you start testing the models, especially when you have made predictions multiple times, check the saving directory that it either contains the predictions you have made in the previous iteration or is empty. If you use different test data with the same yaml file, you might end up having predictions from different csv files and evaluation doesn't work. Mind this especially, if you get an **AssertionError**.*\n",

    "\n",
    "The script performs the evaluation automatically after the predictions are made. In the evaluation phase, `metrics.py` is used from `/src/modeling/` to compute the wanted metrics. The evaluation metrics will be saved in the same directory as the predictions and is in the form of a `pickle` file. ROC curves are also drawn as previously, and they are saved in a `png` format."
